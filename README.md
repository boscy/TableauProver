# TableauProver
This is a repository for the Bachelor's project for Artificial Intelligence.
A logical inference prover for temporal logic was made in python, using the tableau method. 
The algorithm creates a readable human-like tableau to check the validity of input inferences. 
For invalid inferences, a counter-model is provided in the output.
